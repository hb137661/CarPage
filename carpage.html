    <h3 align="center">Ford Mustang</h3>
    <img src="FordMustang.jpg" alt="FordMustang">
    <p align="center">Currently the 2017 Mustang is available with three different motors under the hood, each able to give you more than enough juice whenever you press the gas.
       For those looking for a more efficient ride around town, the Mustang’s 2.3-liter EcoBoost® Inline 4 is a viable option.
      Not only can it provide up to 310 horsepower (!) but you’re also afforded 30 highway miles per gallon!

<h3 align="center">Challenger</h3>
<img src="Challenger.jpg" alt="Challenger">
<p align="center">The Challenger is one big bruiser, with heft better suited to cruising or drag-racing at the strip than turning laps on a racetrack.
  Powertrains include the standard 305-hp 3.6-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic; one 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 makes 375 hp with the standard six-speed manual, and one (with fuel-saving tech) makes 372 hp with the optional eight-speed auto.
  The Scat Pack option features a 485-hp 6.4-liter Hemi V-8; a six-speed manual is standard and an eight-speed auto is optional. <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2016-dodge-challenger-review">Click Here</a></p>
<h3 align="center">Charger</h3>
<img src="Charger.jpg" alt="Charger">
<p align="center">Ringbrothers stole the spotlight with its Hellcat-powered AMC Javelin, but it also debuted another
  Mopar machine at the 2017 SEMA show and this one is just as mean looking.
Signifying the Spring Green, Wisconsin company's first-ever Mopar build is a 1969 Dodge Charger dubbed the Defector.
The custom shop arguably didn't pour as much attention into the 1969 Charger as the Javelin build, but it's still a stunner.
The custom Mopar took over 4,700 hours to complete and features some significant body and wheelbase changes, despite Ringbrothers'
goal being to keep the Charger's iconic factory design intact.

<h3 align="center">Chevelle</h3>
<img src="Chevelle.jfif" alt="Challenger">
<p align="center">This 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 is powered by a 402ci V8 from a later car paired to close-ratio Muncie 4-speed manual and Posi-traction rear axle.
   The seller is the fourth owner, and the previous owner added 4k miles from 2001 to late 2016. A copy of the GM build sheet (see gallery) identifies the Factory options
    including the high output L78  396ci
   (375 hp) V8, 4-speed M22 heavy duty close-ratio transmission, 12-bolt Posi-traction rear end with a 4:10 ratio, tachometer, power steering, and power brakes.
   The previous owner had the engine and transmission rebuilt in 2001 with an Edelbrock intake, headers, and a mild cam. The interior was partially refurbished in 2016,
   and the car has received new tires.
    Replacement of two wheel cylinders and an oil change were performed during the seller’s 500 miles of driving.
  This Chevelle is sold with service records dating to 1997 and a clean Ontario title.

  <h3 align="center">Impala</h3>
  <img src="Impala.jpg" alt="Impala">
  <p align="center">There were several engine choices including the inline 6 cylinder as well as the small block and big block V8s.
     The all-new Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 automatic transmission was optional for 396 cu in big block V8.
     (Unfortunately, the 409-cubic-inch “W” engine was discontinued early in the 1965 model year)The two-speed Powerglide, and Chevrolet impala 396 enginethe manual transmissions were still available.
      The 1966 Impala would become the 2nd best selling  convertible in the country, with near 117,000 units sold across all body styles. The obvious home run hitting body style was the SS with the 396 and the Muncie 4 speed.
       The average MSRP back then was about $2,789, today a 2 door SS hardtop is valued near $40,000
